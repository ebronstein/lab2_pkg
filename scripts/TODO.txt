- adjust the approach direction. Change look_at_general to return a rotation matrix with the y-axis as given (the y-axis of the gripper) and the z-axis as vertical (facing downward) as possible (we could just get the most vertical facing upwards and then rotate).
- make sure we're using the gripper min distance and max distance properly
- do the grasps for the force closure metric
- code up the gravity resistance metric
- code up the ferrari-canny metric
- do grasps with the other 2 metrics
